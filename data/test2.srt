1
00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:06,440
What if you can see what's actually working on YouTube right now before everybody else,

2
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:08,120
backed by data?

3
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:15,599
One of the largest studies of 50,000 YouTube channels was conducted and it actually revealed 12

4
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:19,160
new shifts that are driving YouTube growth right now.

5
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:20,640
This is an opinion.

6
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,960
They actually spent $10,000 on this study and your cost is $0.00.

7
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:29,980
I've got this broken down into the 12 insights based on questions.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,840
And this is one of the biggest questions that comes in all the time, right?

9
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:36,340
What is the best video length on YouTube right now?

10
00:00:36,439 --> 00:00:39,380
Well, there's actually an answer based off real data.

11
00:00:39,799 --> 00:00:40,460
So check this out.

12
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:45,240
The ideal video length, if your videos are going to be under an hour,

13
00:00:45,799 --> 00:00:49,019
is between 16 and 26 minutes.

14
00:00:49,019 --> 00:00:53,000
The actual range in the study is for videos under an hour.

15
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:57,980
The sweet spot is 15 to 25 minutes for your videos.

16
00:00:58,140 --> 00:00:59,980
And they revealed that the danger.

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,159
zone is 30 to 60 minutes. Now, how does this data show up? Well, there's a lot of information on the

18
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:13,140
page here, but right there you can see the danger zone. Shout out to Top Gun 1 with Tom Cruise. And there's

19
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:19,359
kind of a dip if your videos are in between 30 minutes to one hour. And what's fascinating, though,

20
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:27,439
is if we get into longer videos, like 150 minutes to 180 minutes long, then they really start to

21
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,060
fascinating. And that's because longer videos means more watch time, which means stronger

22
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:41,260
recommendations. So here's the big insight. How long should your videos be? Well, longer videos

23
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:46,439
that are over an hour tend to perform better on average. But if your videos are going to be

24
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:52,719
under an hour, the sweet spot is 15 to 25 minutes. Now, this is probably the best YouTube

25
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:56,760
tips video on the internet because this isn't just some like regurgitated info. This is some new

26
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:08,280
strategists from one of 10.com. That's where this study came from. They sourced 300,000 viral

27
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:15,520
videos, actual outliers, 62.6 billion views from 52,000 different channels, and they spent

28
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:20,819
$10,000 on this study. And these are some of the biggest insights. Here's the second one of 12.

29
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:28,420
Number two, does the best video length depend on your niche? Well, fascinating. Now, there's a lot of

30
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,199
But for example, this channel, think media, is a tech channel.

31
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:38,060
And the ideal video length is 28 minutes.

32
00:02:38,699 --> 00:02:40,400
And the way they're studying that is, again,

33
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:45,819
you're getting more views, median views, based on the length of the video.

34
00:02:45,979 --> 00:02:47,180
And it's a big range.

35
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:51,039
But if you're doing gaming or entertainment or sports, 15 to 30 minutes,

36
00:02:51,479 --> 00:02:54,139
finance, business, or tech, 25 to 40 minutes.

37
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:58,539
I will link to the study in the description so you can look into it for yourself

38
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,620
the video and zoom in. But here's the thing. Most creators ask, how long should my video be?

39
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:12,460
Here's the better question. How long does my viewer expect the video to be? Because different

40
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:19,580
niches, the expectation of the audience is going to determine really your ideal video length.

41
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:25,199
And so the answer on video length is there is really no one size fits all. You want to be thinking

42
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:37,939
Niche's consistently support longer form content, food, DIY tutorial videos, kind of peak

43
00:03:37,939 --> 00:03:39,599
with shorter to mid-length videos.

44
00:03:40,039 --> 00:03:42,879
Now, number three is how long should your titles be?

45
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,419
This is where things get interesting.

46
00:03:44,919 --> 00:03:49,379
And actually, towards the end of the video, I'm going to be breaking down the four things

47
00:03:49,379 --> 00:03:53,939
you need to consider for coming up with the personalized strategy for you.

48
00:03:53,939 --> 00:03:59,719
But here is the interesting things when it comes to how long should your YouTube

49
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:07,060
be? Well, here's the sweet spot. Five, six, seven, or eight words before things really start going

50
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:13,960
downhill. That's not a lot of words. So the shorter, the title, the better. Now, I was looking

51
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:19,180
up some of the videos on our Think Media podcast channel. By the way, if you want a good weekly YouTube

52
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:26,279
podcast, check out the Think Media podcast. And this video crushed, and it has a total of six

53
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,279
And it really outperformed a lot of our other videos.

54
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:34,779
There's a lot of other things going on there as well.

55
00:04:34,839 --> 00:04:35,379
How about this one?

56
00:04:35,399 --> 00:04:36,339
This one's eight words.

57
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:38,480
The future of YouTube do this before 2026.

58
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:39,959
Now, this is interesting.

59
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:43,060
This is a podcast interview, longer form.

60
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:46,319
I mean, an hour and 30 minutes, but check out the title,

61
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:52,620
genius personal branding tips with the guest interview, the person I'm interviewing.

62
00:04:52,779 --> 00:04:57,040
So that is a total of seven words if you count the W with the slash.

63
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,160
get nearly 60% more views.

64
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:04,540
30 characters.

65
00:05:04,839 --> 00:05:05,560
That's short.

66
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:09,259
So shorter titles are better than longer titles.

67
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,319
In fact, if you dig even deeper,

68
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:16,600
you can see here that the view count drops,

69
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,800
that blue line in the middle,

70
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:20,639
as the title gets longer.

71
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:24,560
And then also right here where the red arrow is pointing,

72
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,560
that's 70 characters, which is also important to know.

73
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,980
This is where YouTube begins.

74
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,579
to cut the title off on certain displays.

75
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,639
You understand that, right?

76
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:36,019
Like some, even if you have a really long title,

77
00:05:36,139 --> 00:05:37,259
it gets like a dot, dot, dot.

78
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:42,740
It gets cut off depending on where the viewer is engaging with the video.

79
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:46,139
So really shorter titles are better.

80
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:48,660
However, there's kind of an exception here,

81
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:51,500
and that's education versus entertainment.

82
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:57,399
So what we're looking out here is that entertainment videos are the red line.

83
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,740
Five words, six words is way outperforming.

84
00:06:04,779 --> 00:06:07,839
And then the line starts to drop pretty significantly, the red line,

85
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,319
as you add more words to your title.

86
00:06:10,819 --> 00:06:15,079
If you notice on education, it's really not that dramatic.

87
00:06:15,319 --> 00:06:18,399
I would still prefer to get more views on the left side, right?

88
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,920
But it's more of like a flat line.

89
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:27,000
So title length matters far more for entertainment videos than it does for education videos.

90
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,899
Remember, entertainment content is clicked

91
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,040
on impulse. So it creates, you know, you want to trigger curiosity, trigger emotion,

92
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:42,500
you want to win attention. Here's the big takeaway. Shorter titles win. And educational videos can be

93
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:48,920
a little longer, but still, shorter is still safer if you can condense your thoughts in the title.

94
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:54,759
Keep it simple, clear, fast to understand. And titles around 30 characters get way more clicks

95
00:06:54,759 --> 00:06:59,839
than long ones. Number five, should I put my face in the thumbnail?

96
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,959
This is fascinating.

97
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:08,420
What they discovered in this report is that there's actually minimal difference in performance.

98
00:07:08,839 --> 00:07:13,519
So what you see in the education on the left, entertainment on the right,

99
00:07:14,339 --> 00:07:19,959
and education, if you have a face, it actually does a little bit better than not having a face.

100
00:07:19,959 --> 00:07:23,519
And on entertainment, no face does better.

101
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:25,360
Okay, so no face does better in entertainment.

102
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:28,660
No face does a little bit weaker in education.

103
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:29,819
What's the big takeaway?

104
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,720
is that it's actually pretty close.

105
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:33,819
However, this shocked me.

106
00:07:34,439 --> 00:07:36,079
If you dive into this, I know this is small.

107
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,779
You might need to zoom in on your mobile phone.

108
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:39,819
But let's just look at business content.

109
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,980
So business content that has a face

110
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:48,300
does not as well as no face in business content.

111
00:07:48,459 --> 00:07:49,939
Now, here's a couple of disclaimers, right?

112
00:07:50,339 --> 00:07:52,540
You have to start thinking about there's faceless channels.

113
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:56,019
Maybe they're talking about repurposing content, other people's content.

114
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:58,759
And people are just clicking on the topic itself,

115
00:07:58,759 --> 00:07:59,939
and they want to learn something.

116
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,680
versus they're clicking on your face because you have some level of awareness as a personal brand.

117
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:04,959
You should consider those things.

118
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:06,220
But let's dive a little bit deeper.

119
00:08:06,839 --> 00:08:12,240
If you look at lifestyle and vlog, of course, having a face outperforms, not having a face.

120
00:08:12,579 --> 00:08:14,000
Probably because they know you.

121
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:18,319
However, lifestyle and vlog is also probably because they can relate to you.

122
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:22,800
So maybe if you want to reach new people with your vlog, you know, people watch people of all kinds

123
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,939
of different shapes and sizes.

124
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:29,980
But like if I'm a particular millennial mom that's blonde with five kids,

125
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,579
shopping at Costco.

126
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,379
I might follow other creators that I can kind of relate with.

127
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:38,440
So seeing who you're following matters in lifestyle and vlogging,

128
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:44,000
whereas, you know, even in tech down here, still having a face outperforms,

129
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,379
not having a face, but it's pretty close.

130
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:47,980
Now, this is even crazier.

131
00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:54,779
Depending on how many faces, no face outperformed one face.

132
00:08:54,779 --> 00:08:59,159
But if you've got two, three, or four faces, it jumped up even higher.

133
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,299
So that's interesting and why the one of 10 who did this study.

134
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:06,580
And again, I'll link to the Twitter of it.

135
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:11,360
And you can also actually download the full thing in the link of the bio of the account.

136
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:17,639
You know, they revealed that if there's multiple faces, it could be there's a moment happening,

137
00:09:18,299 --> 00:09:22,259
a reaction of conflict maybe, or multiple people in the conversation.

138
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,159
It's going to be interesting.

139
00:09:23,299 --> 00:09:24,860
There's something happening there.

140
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:28,679
And again, this is based on real data and not just somebody's opinion.

141
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:29,980
So should you have?

142
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,480
a face in your thumbnail. Well, it's going to depend on your niche, but overall, there's minimal

143
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:40,799
difference in performance. If you are a finance creator, you're doing business or education,

144
00:09:40,799 --> 00:09:46,000
a face in general can signify trust, like I'm going to learn from a person and it's not just some

145
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:53,360
like chat cheapy-t AI script. Whereas if it's gaming, it's maybe, you know, Donkey Kong in Mario

146
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:58,399
Cart World, and that's like the hero, speed run. You're actually seeing the game, you're seeing the character.

147
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,519
or movie reaction. Maybe it's the, you know, the movie trailer of some kind.

148
00:10:04,179 --> 00:10:10,659
And so what's the star? And you learn that two faces can outperform one face in a thumbnail.

149
00:10:10,899 --> 00:10:14,440
Number six, should I add text to my thumbnail?

150
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:19,200
These should rock you. Let me know if you're surprised and hit the like button if you like content

151
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:19,740
like this.

152
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:29,940
Median views by text versus no text. No text radically outperformed thumbnails with text

153
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:38,440
in them. In fact, thumbnails with text get 19% fewer views on average. Wow. So you should try an attempt

154
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:44,620
to publish thumbnails with no text in them. Now look at this. You can see this strong

155
00:10:45,539 --> 00:10:53,759
amount of meeting views hold strong. If you do include text, it is only up to 7% of the thumbnail.

156
00:10:54,379 --> 00:10:59,820
Now let me put that in perspective. That's not a lot of the thumbnail. That is what 7% is. The little

157
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,360
box of an entire YouTube thumbnail.

158
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:03,840
Basically nothing.

159
00:11:04,419 --> 00:11:09,360
So the big takeaway was if you can keep text out of your thumbnail, views go up,

160
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,620
click through rate goes up.

161
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,879
You know, on Think Media here, we do a lot of tech content,

162
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,639
and we have been always attempting to have no text in the thumbnail.

163
00:11:18,759 --> 00:11:21,740
Great example, best webcams for every budget, no text.

164
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:25,519
Here is a good example of just one word.

165
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:27,820
That looks like about 7%.

166
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:29,720
It's kind of almost perfect to what it just said.

167
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,799
That's like 10% and then a little arrow pointing to it.

168
00:11:33,179 --> 00:11:36,220
So like a simple emotion, something about, you know, whatever.

169
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,159
And a lot of times, again, we're striving to go no text.

170
00:11:40,259 --> 00:11:41,720
Let the title do the heavy lifting.

171
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:44,440
You can see some stacked principles here.

172
00:11:44,559 --> 00:11:49,139
This can in our six video, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, eight words.

173
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:52,539
So trying to keep your title short, punchy, and still clear.

174
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:58,240
But when necessary, remember in education, you can certainly go longer with the title

175
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,759
because there's a different.

176
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,799
Education viewers have intent to learn usually where entertainment viewers are really driven

177
00:12:05,799 --> 00:12:09,480
off emotion. You're trying to get the click-through rate, get suggested in browse features.

178
00:12:10,039 --> 00:12:13,860
And here's a great thumbnail that does the storytelling. I think that's what we're after.

179
00:12:14,279 --> 00:12:20,379
There's no text in the thumbnail title, I tested 36 wireless microphones. Here are the best in a 14x

180
00:12:20,379 --> 00:12:26,519
outlier here on our Think Media channel. So the question of should you include text in your thumbnail,

181
00:12:26,919 --> 00:12:29,980
usually no. Show the idea. Don't label.

182
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:37,340
the idea. If you do use text, keep it under 10 characters, not words, 10 characters, and make it

183
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:44,299
tiny or keep it really minimal and bottom line, let the image do the talking. Number seven, how bright

184
00:12:44,299 --> 00:12:49,500
should your thumbnails be? Your thumbnails should be bright, is the answer. The brighter of the thumbnail,

185
00:12:49,659 --> 00:12:56,399
the better. And they did a bunch of ninja stuff based off of gray scale zero and measuring the

186
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Natural brightness, 99 to like 100 is good, but a little bit brighter.

187
00:13:05,779 --> 00:13:11,379
Like if you go into Canva or Photoshop, right, and a little bit brighter than even 100%

188
00:13:11,379 --> 00:13:18,019
is where the higher performance was when it came to how bright should your thumbnails be.

189
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:21,799
Bottom line, brighter equals better, darker thumbnails get skipped.

190
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:23,059
You want to pop in the feed.

191
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,440
They're easier to see.

192
00:13:24,559 --> 00:13:25,440
They get more clicks.

193
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:29,519
Number eight, what thumbnail colors work best?

194
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,320
This is a gangster report.

195
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,360
Are you enjoying this?

196
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:39,440
Ultimately, cyan, green, and yellow, orange performed the best you see in the middle there.

197
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:46,639
Now, quick caveat for this whole report is, you know, I think you could overanalyze some of these things

198
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:52,080
because, of course, I want to get the median views of 63,000 or 62,000.

199
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:56,600
But, you know, I'll still take 47,000 over here with like a white background or something.

200
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,559
So, you know, be realistic.

201
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,899
Virality is not accidental.

202
00:14:02,899 --> 00:14:05,000
Like, these things do matter.

203
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,899
So understanding that these colors win, cyan, green, yellow, orange,

204
00:14:09,899 --> 00:14:14,000
because they pop against YouTube's most neutral feed, mostly neutral feed,

205
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,039
they signal energy and clarity without visual fatigue.

206
00:14:17,039 --> 00:14:22,100
I was surprised that red performed so poorly because some marketers, like, use red,

207
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:23,460
like it's really going to get attention.

208
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:24,919
Like, that'll shock people.

209
00:14:24,919 --> 00:14:26,820
But maybe there's resistance to that.

210
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:29,559
You know, let me know your thoughts about these,

211
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,500
insights. And when you think about where YouTube is consumed, are people in dark mode?

212
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:41,559
Are they in white mode on their device? You want to preserve contrast even after YouTube's compression.

213
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:49,580
So the bottom line for what colors win most often in thumbnails, green, cyan, yellow, orange.

214
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:55,779
Now, number nine is do numbers help in your title? Should you put a number in your title?

215
00:14:55,779 --> 00:14:59,580
Well, videos with numbers get 11% fewer views.

216
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:07,120
on average. Okay. So if a title has numbers, the median views across the niches and the

217
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:16,480
videos they studied was around 42,000 with no numbers that went up to, to 48,000 views. So out of the

218
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:22,600
study, 35% of the videos in the study included numbers in the titles. So three out of ten videos that

219
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:27,100
they studied had numbers in the title. But what it revealed was that if you can get the number

220
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:29,500
out of the title, you could get your views to go up.

221
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,460
And so why is that?

222
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:39,580
Well, numbers signify lists, explainers, tutorials, but they ultimately, they clarify structure,

223
00:15:39,879 --> 00:15:42,059
but what people click on YouTube videos for is emotion.

224
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:44,919
And I think you could apply this in education as well.

225
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:47,940
A number is like, oh, I got to actually learn some things.

226
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,059
Now, you're watching this video because you want to learn some things,

227
00:15:50,179 --> 00:15:54,480
but, you know, usually want to click because of the emotion and then you get into the things

228
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,019
you're going to learn.

229
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,559
Like, it's okay to have a list in your video.

230
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:59,519
So if you can package the video without a number,

231
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:05,799
It's interesting. Then don't include numbers in your titles. People click for a motion,

232
00:16:05,919 --> 00:16:11,960
not structure. Numbers can still work, but they're not a cheat code. And by the way, these rules are

233
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:17,799
meant to be broken because, of course, you know, if I tested 36 mics, that's part of the story.

234
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:24,399
You know, if you click on the fact I visited 13 states. So take this information with a grain of salt,

235
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:28,860
but also understand that the knowledge of this video, I'd probably even rewatch this video and save it,

236
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:35,500
But this is real stuff. Number 10, what emotions get the most clicks?

237
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:43,379
Hmm. So across their study, the emotions that get the most clicks were joy and funny content,

238
00:16:43,559 --> 00:16:51,820
second, controversy, third, anger, fourth, fear, and then nostalgia, curiosity, relatable, sad, and desire.

239
00:16:52,299 --> 00:16:58,840
Desire is way down there. And this is a well-known marketing principle that most people will avoid pain

240
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,399
and they will pursue pleasure.

241
00:17:02,139 --> 00:17:04,579
And so we have this desire and this thing we want to achieve.

242
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:05,839
Of course, we click on that.

243
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:10,440
But more often, we're going to click on, oh, pain could be coming or change is coming.

244
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:12,259
So that's super interesting.

245
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:15,099
In fact, you know, you talk about fear.

246
00:17:16,339 --> 00:17:21,740
One of the videos that popped off for us, 25X outlier, was why YouTubers are getting sued,

247
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:23,880
fear and controversy.

248
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:28,799
The biggest legal mistakes creators make also fear, am I making those legal mistakes?

249
00:17:29,319 --> 00:17:29,880
And again,

250
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:35,779
what is the six words? One, two, three, four, five, six words. So a lot of best practices

251
00:17:35,779 --> 00:17:40,799
proving true. And then, of course, the strength of the topic itself. So the answer to this one is,

252
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:48,680
what are the top emotions that get the most views is humor, anger, and controversy? It doesn't mean

253
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:55,400
that's the only content you should create, but it does mean that you should create some of that content.

254
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:59,740
And your title's job is not to explain everything. It's to,

255
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:06,079
make people feel something. Number 11, are negative titles better than positive ones?

256
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:12,259
We just touched on that, but check it out. In education on the left, positive titles did the worst.

257
00:18:12,619 --> 00:18:19,200
Neutral did the next best, and then negative did the best in educational content. And entertainment

258
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:25,119
was the same thing. Positive entertainment titles did the worst. Neutral did better. And negative

259
00:18:25,119 --> 00:18:29,799
did a little bit better. And so ultimately, negativity.

260
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:36,240
in titles generally performs better, and whether that's educational or entertainment content.

261
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:40,599
And you might go, you know, I don't just, I don't want to go into the doom and gloom or I don't want

262
00:18:40,599 --> 00:18:44,660
to be that type of creator. Well, great, that's totally fine. But it might be a tool in your tool belt

263
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:49,619
that you want to use sometimes. And there might be a way to package things where you can still be aligned

264
00:18:49,619 --> 00:18:54,559
with your ethics, your values, and like the kind of content you want to make. Or like also what we'd

265
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:59,380
call ethically click-click baiting. You know, clickbait incit incinuates deception.

266
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:07,000
But if you're ethically clickbaiting, you're ultimately skilled at getting people to click on your content,

267
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:13,279
but delivering in the video in such a way where it's all authentic and not deceptive in any way.

268
00:19:14,039 --> 00:19:14,980
And so I thought about this.

269
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:21,500
You know, the think media team packaged a really good video about the Roadcaster VideoS.

270
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:26,980
And, you know, creating a little bit of drama did Road just destroyed the Atem?

271
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:28,539
Of course, that's one of the best switchers.

272
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:29,500
Historically, RoadDropics.

273
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:36,059
a new product. So the positioning of the video kind of came into, you know, somewhat of a negative

274
00:19:36,059 --> 00:19:42,099
or a dramatic approach. And that's a great way to package something. And maybe 99% of tech

275
00:19:42,099 --> 00:19:49,700
creators wouldn't do it that way. Hence, you know, we continue to have high performing videos here at

276
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:55,039
think media. Answer, should you have negative titles or do negative titles perform better than

277
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:59,799
positive ones? Yes, they most of the time perform better. Because,

278
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,440
negative titles create tension. They trigger curiosity and they feel more urgent.

279
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:13,420
Neutral is safe. Negative is clickable. Now, in just a second, the big takeaway here is the question of,

280
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:17,819
how do I apply this to my own channel? And how do I apply all these things, whether I'm in entertainment

281
00:20:17,819 --> 00:20:22,599
or education? I've got four things we all need to know. I'm going to share that in just a second.

282
00:20:22,599 --> 00:20:27,000
But let's hit number 12 based on this report. What niches blow up easiest right now?

283
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,980
Ooh, it's a juicy question. What are the best chance?

284
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:35,279
channel topics. If you want to blow up easiest, there's actually a formula for this, I'll share in a

285
00:20:35,279 --> 00:20:44,799
second, but here is what they shared in this report. You want to be in the upper right towards the

286
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:52,839
top. So median views is on the left. That's the Y axis. And the outlier score is on the X out

287
00:20:52,839 --> 00:20:57,099
axis. So what are the, if you're going to have breakout videos consistently, you want the best of both worlds.

288
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:59,980
And so in the top right, what you're going to do? And so in the top right, what you're going to do you know,

289
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:06,960
see is movies and TV. You see music. You see sports up there. And then you also see

290
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:14,319
other. Well, what does other mean? Well, other includes animals, politics, history. Now, there's a really

291
00:21:14,319 --> 00:21:20,400
strong insight we're going to learn in just a second. But what these combine is strong baseline demand,

292
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:28,460
frequent external trends, and a high outlier potential. A lot of fancy words. So you want a lot of baseline

293
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:35,539
people are interested in this. Frequent trends. If I was taking notes, that's what I would write down.

294
00:21:35,539 --> 00:21:43,420
Does my niche have frequent trends? And is there a high outlier potential in my niche? The best ones

295
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:52,660
combine these things. So trends manufacture breakout videos, massive insight. So if your niche has

296
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:58,539
frequent trends, you have the opportunity to have frequent breakout videos. For example, in business and

297
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,859
that wasn't one of the hottest blow-up niches. And I'll know a lot of people that subscribe to us

298
00:22:03,859 --> 00:22:08,900
are in that niche. They have lower medium views, lower outliers, if you're in business and finance.

299
00:22:09,619 --> 00:22:15,380
And that doesn't mean it's a bad thing. It just means that, you know, finance is way down in the lower left

300
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:20,819
there. Business is on the right side a little bit further along. And it just means that it's harder.

301
00:22:20,819 --> 00:22:27,720
So it's like, depending on the channel topic you select, breaking out consistently might be a little bit

302
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:35,519
what is the best niche to start? Well, let's summarize it into a formula. You want a big

303
00:22:35,519 --> 00:22:42,160
audience and constant trends. You want a big audience. There's a marketing term, a business term,

304
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:47,799
called Tam, and it stands for the total addressable market, which speaks to the size of the market.

305
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:54,259
How big is the potential audience? And then the second piece of the framework or this formula is,

306
00:22:54,339 --> 00:22:59,640
is there consistent trends happening? Is there constant trends happening in that topic? Because if there is,

307
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,819
constantly have things to talk about and new things to talk about. And then there's a big

308
00:23:03,819 --> 00:23:09,079
enough audience that even if competition is fierce, there's a big audience for it. And so in the report,

309
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:16,000
they talked about movies and TV, music, politics, animals, history. And yes, trends happen in business

310
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,839
and finance, but you always got to know that even people that are pursuing building a business or, you know,

311
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:26,039
personal development and stuff, is always way smaller than people that are looking for movie content or

312
00:23:26,039 --> 00:23:29,720
history content or animal content, you know. What are the coolest,

313
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:36,119
snakes on a plane. You know what I mean? And so one of the big insights here is virality isn't

314
00:23:36,119 --> 00:23:43,559
actually random. Like, it really can be architected. And so this report reveals insight is step one. And I

315
00:23:43,559 --> 00:23:47,640
got four ways to apply this for you personally. But inside is step one, like knowing these 12 things,

316
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:54,920
but execution is step two. Knowing is not enough. Most people fail because they actually fail to apply

317
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:59,420
this information to their channel. And this includes things like delivery. Can you talk on camera,

318
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,539
structure, consistency. So by the way, if you're committed to doing YouTube this year,

319
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:09,000
we have an event coming up. It's three days. It's free. It's going to be amazing. It's called

320
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:13,460
the YouTube Growth Sprint. It's all about helping you get results fast. There's a link in the

321
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:19,140
description if you want to register.Ytsprint.com. Three days of live training of a community.

322
00:24:19,819 --> 00:24:23,859
And we're not just talking about what works. We're talking about how to apply it. It's a kick in the

323
00:24:23,859 --> 00:24:28,059
pants. It's lighting a fire under your butt. We're going to go deep on making videos. People

324
00:24:28,059 --> 00:24:29,980
actually want to watch. How do you actually start?

325
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:35,460
your content so that your retention doesn't fall apart. How about speaking on camera?

326
00:24:35,579 --> 00:24:40,319
How about making videos in the first place? And how do you actually build momentum instead of just

327
00:24:40,319 --> 00:24:45,299
posting random content? So this is going to be a lot of fun. And by the way, we do a ton of

328
00:24:45,299 --> 00:24:51,440
giveaways. We give away software, cameras, light kits, microphones, all that kind of stuff.

329
00:24:51,519 --> 00:24:55,759
So you can register for free. YTSprint.com. You know, it's our biggest event of the year. We always do

330
00:24:55,759 --> 00:24:59,900
that stuff in January. Highly recommend you register, attend. It's going to be

331
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:07,240
fun and ytsprint.com is where you can get registered for that. If YouTube matters to you

332
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:11,619
matters to you this year, don't sit on the sidelines, get registered is completely free.

333
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:15,819
Now, I talked about four things. Here's what the right YouTube strategy depends on.

334
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:22,119
Number one, your niche. So education or entertainment, that's number two, intent,

335
00:25:22,359 --> 00:25:25,980
education or entertainment. So what's the right YouTube strategy for you?

336
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:35,900
concept, you know, simple story driven thumbnail. For educational creators who are sitting

337
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:39,880
down and teaching someone to code, you could be getting millions of views or ranking videos

338
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:44,220
in an entirely different way. You know, you might want to do an AI tutorial that's like how to

339
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:52,700
master chat GPT in 2026, GBT's projects. You might want to even still tap into searchable aspects

340
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:58,180
of YouTube. So it depends. So what niche are you in? What's the intent of your audience? Are you in

341
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,640
of the day. Do you have an education channel or an entertainment channel? Let me know.

342
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:11,480
Also your channel size. And then also the viewer expectation. Very underrated insight.

343
00:26:12,019 --> 00:26:17,779
What is the viewer expectation? Meaning how well do you understand your audience? And here's some homework.

344
00:26:18,539 --> 00:26:23,599
People hate homework, but I'll give you it anyways. Have you studied your niche? So remember,

345
00:26:23,599 --> 00:26:29,299
we want to look and see that the median amount of views that different topics get varies depending on

346
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:35,279
topic. So if you're out here thinking, you know, you're making 22 minute videos or an hour

347
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:40,059
hour and a half videos, does your niche support that? What are the best practices and video lengths

348
00:26:40,059 --> 00:26:46,099
and title formats of outliers in your niche? These are really good questions to ask. So the right

349
00:26:46,099 --> 00:26:51,859
YouTube strategy depends really on dialing in it personally for you. It's one of the things we'll be

350
00:26:51,859 --> 00:26:57,380
doing on the YouTube sprint. And this report reviewed a few other, a few other deeper things.

351
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:05,960
and definitely diving the report more. It's a full like 100 page thing. And so there's a few

352
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:11,680
other insights that I saved for the end. And one of the kind of interesting things that the whole

353
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:16,759
report reveals is that creators are optimizing for what's easy to control, not what actually

354
00:27:16,759 --> 00:27:23,319
matters. Here's what I mean. Most people's videos on YouTube overall are four to 10 minutes across

355
00:27:23,319 --> 00:27:29,980
the platform. But peak performance is closer to 18 to 24 minutes. So it's like,

356
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,920
Like the majority is still just doing what everybody's doing, but the data shows like four to 10 minutes.

357
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,920
Again, you can break the rules, but like 18 to 24 is better.

358
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:41,759
Like, are you making data-driven decisions? When now you have this video and this report.

359
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:46,740
84% of thumbnails include text. 84% of thumbnails include text.

360
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:50,319
But text reduces views by 19%.

361
00:27:50,319 --> 00:27:55,480
So creators are optimizing for what's easy to control or what everybody's doing instead of what actually works.

362
00:27:56,279 --> 00:27:58,480
Titles average 10 words across YouTube.

363
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:06,640
performance drops sharply if you go longer than six words, exception for educational content.

364
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:16,339
So really, this reveals like creators copy norms. They don't copy what works. It's smarter to do what works.

365
00:28:16,339 --> 00:28:24,640
And then one big takeaway is lower cognitive load wins everywhere. Let's define what that means

366
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:36,579
The shorter it is, the easy, every word adds more cognitive load makes your brain work harder.

367
00:28:37,079 --> 00:28:44,759
So all of us, education or entertainment, should ask, how can we simplify our concepts and make the viewer work less to be able to click on this video.

368
00:28:45,579 --> 00:28:50,240
So creating a lower cognitive load wins across niches.

369
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:54,019
That's your title length. It's your title character count.

370
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:59,559
Reading ease scores, like how easy it is to read text in your thumb,

371
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:05,740
thumbnail text size and even fewer characters in thumbnails. If you're going to use

372
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:11,980
titles, bottom line, it's like simple packaging, okay? Simple packaging. And you are responsible for

373
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:19,039
your own content. If you oversimplify too far, you might lose clarity. So it's like this process that

374
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:24,200
we have as entrepreneurs and creators to refine our concepts down to make them as simple as possible

375
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:29,619
just to reduce cognitive load because lower cognitive load wins everywhere.

376
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:34,579
To summarize, make it longer the people expected, long videos are crushing YouTube,

377
00:29:34,759 --> 00:29:42,599
make it simpler than you think and make it easier to click on than everything else around it.

378
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:47,859
And by the way, we've been covering how to get views, but now let's talk about how to make money.

379
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:51,140
I actually did a video on how small channels are making $50 per day.

380
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:57,680
It's already a 7.8x outlier. People love this video. You can click or tap the screen to watch it.

381
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,039
profitable YouTube channel. Hit the like button and I can't wait to connect with you in a
